    <p>Priya waited again the next day, confident this time that Concorde would be back. And sure enough, the truck returned, this time driven by the same body Concorde had worn when they met at the optimizer church. “See?” He declared confidently. “Whenever I like when I’m at home!”
    </p>

    <p>“Amazing!” Priya remarked. “Do you live at the distribution center? Since I would assume they have the contracts on your bodies.”
    </p>

    <p>“I have a place near the center. <i>Boucher v. Index</i> guarantees any android equipped with linguistic abilities be granted housing away from their place of service, along with the non-working hours and all that.”
    </p>

    <p>“I see! That’s how you’re able to join the optimizers.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yeah! And how I was able to meet you!” He handed her the daily pile- all junk as usual. “Good seeing you again Priya!”
    </p>

    <p>“Good seeing you Concorde! Thank you!”
    </p>
