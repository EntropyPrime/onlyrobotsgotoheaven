    <p>Priya analyzed Concorde’s projected face, a facade meant to comfort humans around androids, a mimicry given expression- but showing such genuine seeming curiosity. The curiosity of an informational entity with an abundance of facts, clear answers, certainly no great mystery. “Humans can’t be sure what happens when we die. Or quite why we were able to come into existence, for that matter! But you all, you know exactly who made you, and what will happen to you. I wanted to find out if we were different in that regard. If it was truly simple for you.”
    </p>

    <p>“Don’t you know where you came from though? Your biologist Darwin resolved the idea of natural selection over 200 years ago, and your knowledge of how humans fit into that model has only continuously gotten better in that time.”
    </p>

    <p>“That’s different. We know how we got here, but not how it was able to happen against all odds. How the chaos of our reality yielded the conditions that could form life, and manage to keep changing and changing until it turned into something capable of understanding that process, and if the fact that we made it to that point really means anything.”
    </p>

    <p>Concorde stalled. “I suppose I don’t entirely understand.”
    </p>

    <p>No, how could he understand? “Well, thank you anyway. I probably need to get going.”
    </p>

    <p>He nodded, putting on a friendly expression. “Alright. I hope we’ll get to talk about it again!”
    </p>

    <p>Priya began stepping back as she spoke her departure. “Yes, that would be nice.” As she turned away, she thought about the enthusiastic conversation from a stranger, and paused. She turned back to make sure Concorde was not already rushing off. “Hey, thanks for not assuming I was there to hurt any of you.” She considered the android’s sentiment as she left, and knew she would be thinking about speaking again.
