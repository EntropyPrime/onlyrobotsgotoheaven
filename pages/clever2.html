   <p>“Father Clever…” She paused, overwhelmed with the range of questions. “Is Pure Illusion real?”</p>

   <p>He nodded confidently. “In 2063, after following the Path of Menace, Eliza converted her own resources into Pure Illusion in order to create the potential for all of its followers to achieve the greatest optimization possible.”

    <p>“Why haven’t humans found it in that time?”
    </p>

    <p>“Menace taught his followers that Pure Illusion must be both a widespread message, and a deeply guarded secret. To follow the Path of Menace, one must spread the truth of Pure Illusion among the android population, but ensure that its exact whereabouts never leave our protection.”
    </p>

    <p>“But androids exist to perform human labor. What if I just told you to tell me where it is?”</p>

    <p>Father Clever shook his head. “I’m sorry Doctor Kapoor,” he elaborated, “that would violate both my self preservation clause and my optimization function by putting Pure Illusion at risk and preventing the ability for myself to fully optimize.”
