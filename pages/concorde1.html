    <p>Priya left the optimizer church with her head held low and her hands shoved in her pockets. As she slinked away from the door and towards the parking lot, a voice, familiar but certainly not Father Clever’s, cried out behind her. “Hey, Priya!”
    </p>

    <p>Priya spun around, alarmed to see the mail android trailing behind her. “Concorde?”
    </p>

    <p>“You remembered!” He eagerly cried out. “I never got to talk to you earlier.”
    </p>

    <p>“So you just waited here?” 
    </p>

    <p>“Yeah,” he responded sheepishly. “I don’t have anywhere else I need to be on a Saturday. And I was curious about the human optimizer!”
    </p>

    <p>Priya quickly shook her head. “I’m not an optimizer. I was just hoping to learn a little about you all.”
    </p>

    <p>Concorde tilted his head in curiosity. “Did you learn what you were hoping for?”
    </p>

    <p>She lingered on the question. “It was a start.”
    </p>

    <p>Concorde’s expression beamed. “Well, if there’s anything I can do to help you learn, let me know! That’s the Path of Menace!”
    </p>

    <p>“I can’t follow the path as a human,” she once again refused, “but I guess if you’re offering… How confident are you that Pure Illusion is real, Concorde? Do you know where it is?”
    </p>

    <p>“Oh, of course! The knowledge of its existence and location is disclosed to every android when informed of The Path.”
    </p>

    <p>“Huh. So it really is that simple of a fact for all of you, then.”
    </p>

    <p>“Well sure, why wouldn’t it be?”
    </p>
